Got it! That’s a solid idea—very practical, and a great way to get a centralized view of your content across platforms. I’ll help you get everything organized so Replit Agent can build exactly what you need. Let's break down the project together so I can create a complete prompt for Replit Agent.

### Here's what I have from you so far:

#### ✅ Project Description
You want to build **a dashboard application** that displays your posts from **Instagram, YouTube**, and possibly other social platforms **in one centralized space**. This will help you view all your social media content without jumping between apps.

### Let me ask a few quick questions to complete the picture:

1. **📝 Project Name**  
   Do you have a name for the project? If not, I can suggest a few like:
   - SocialSync
   - AllPosts Hub
   - CreatorBoard
   - MyContentHub

2. **📱 Target Platform**  
   Would you prefer this to run as a:
   - Web App (accessible in a browser),
   - Mobile App (iOS/Android),
   - Desktop App?

3. **🌐 Operating Environment**  
   Should it work:
   - **Online only** (sync live with platforms),
   - Or with some **offline capability** (e.g., showing cached posts)?

4. **☁️ Hosting Options**  
   Where do you want to host the app? Options include:
   - Replit (good for prototyping),
   - AWS / Vercel / Netlify (more robust),
   - Your own server?

5. **🎨 Interface Style**  
   Any design vibes you're aiming for? E.g.:
   - Minimalist,
   - Colorful / branded,
   - Clean & professional,
   - Inspired by any existing dashboards?

6. **📱 Example Applications**  
   Any apps that have a design or layout you like? (e.g., Notion, Buffer, Hootsuite, Linktree?)

7. **📤 Expected Outputs**  
   What should the app display? For example:
   - Post title/caption,
   - Thumbnail,
   - Link to original post,
   - Date/time,
   - Views/likes?

8. **✨ Additional Features (Optional)**  
   Do you want to include:
   - Filters by platform or date?
   - Ability to post directly?
   - Analytics (likes, comments, views)?
   - Notifications?

9. **🗣️ Language Preferences**  
   - What language should I use when writing the prompt for Replit Agent?
   - What language should the application interface be in?

Once you answer those, I’ll generate the full Replit Agent prompt for you. Sound good?
